### Hi there 👋

I am computer science student with a passion for solving different real-life problems and finding interesting solutions. I have a strong interest in mobile application development, electronics, and telecommunication. Proficient in Java, Kotlin, and C++ with deep understanding of the application development cycle and data processing. Familiar with computer vision in the context of image preprocessing algorithms. 

Experienced in working individually or in a group. Able to communicate and help others solve different technical problems. I am also a quick learner, and always eager to take on new challenges. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a group open-source [Robotics and IoT](https://34panda.github.io/docsify/#/) project. My part is the [Lumos](https://github.com/andrew-andrushchenko/Lumos-arduino) room ambient light project.
- 💼 I am looking for an internship or entry-level position in one of these fields: mobile development, software development for electronic devices, or software automation and testing
